# NoteTakerApplication
Creates and categorizes text files

This desktop Java application allows users to assign a title and create a text file which is saved to a 'notes' directory where ever the program is run. By optionally specifying a directory, users can group files together. For example, a note with the title 'part1' and 'world domination plans' as the directory will be found at '/notes/world domination plans/part1.txt'. More sublevels can be added using the '/' character in the directory name.
